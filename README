Cool Form Handling Overview

For each of your html forms, you'd define a form handling class
and include the Joe::Rocks::FormStuff module into it.

This class is an interface / layer between ActionController
and your Models (or whatever you are saving the data to).
You could just send an email after they submit the form.

After you submit the form, the values you submit are put
into a gzip'd encoded cookie with json in it.
This allows us to access the stuff you entered earlier.

When you submit the next form (or the same form again),
the values you submit are merged into the already-submitted
form values that are saved in the cookie.  So, you could submit
an ajax request that only has one form attribute, and it would
merge that one attribute with the other stuff you already submitted
earlier.

We use the standard ActiveModel::Validator stuff.  The
validation_scopes allows us to scope validations, so
we'd only run the validations for certain attributes.
